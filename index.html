                <p>Hello! I'm Dominique.
                I love to read --I am a true nerd &#x1f913; <br></br>.From my very first book I was hooked. I typically read about 100+ books per year, always trying to get more books
                added each year. <br></br> I read just about any genre (haven't really gotten into History though), with my favorite's being Fantasy &#129498;, Thrillers, and Dark Academia. <br></br> Reading has always been a source of enjoyment for me.
                I love that when I read I am instantly transported into the story, taking each of those adventures right along with 
                the characters!
                <br></br>This blog serves as a project for my software engineering portfolio,
                and my blog in order to review the books in my life.<br></br>

            <p class="post-description">This book surprised me I had low expectations going in but as the book progressed it got better and better
                This book introduces you to characters that have been in other stories. Nancy, who reminds me of Persephone is sent to a "boarding school" after she 
                returns from time in the underworld. While her parents want her to get better all that Nancy wants to do is return to the Underworld. Along the way she 
                meets Jack and Jill and others that all have experienced similiar things as Nancy, and they all want to go back to their lands. Do they get their wish. You will just have to read it.

            <p class="post-description">Who doesn't know Harry Potter's story. A boy finds out he's a wizard and finds his home in the wizarding world. There are so many funny and adorable scenes in this book that I wish was in the movies.
                One scene being Sir Nicholas' death day party, and the scenes with Moaning Myrtle. Lockhart was deeper than the movies portrayed, so many wonderful things. Harry Potter is one of those movies that I geek out to and can watch on repeat. 
                I might go watch it now.

                journey that leads him to an ancient magical library far beneath the surface of the Earth. Wondering how his life ended up in the book, he finds clues a bee, a key, and a sword. What Zachary
